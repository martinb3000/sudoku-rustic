Some code for solving a Sudoku puzzle, mostly not using recursion.

I wrote this as an exercise when learning Rust.

Desired functionality:

* Read input on stdin, write formatted solution(s) on stdout.
* Make as many solutions as desired by user.
* Handle Sudoku puzzle of sizes 0x0 up to 16x16 at least.
* The solver shall return the solutions using the Rust
  [Iterator trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/index.html).

Also I wanted to experiment with putting some code up on GitHub.
